Jira is an application for creating, updating and deleting to-do tasks.
Once a new task is created, it is pushed into "New tasks" block. Then, user could move it to other blocks (to-do, in progress, done OR custom user block). Also, creator of the task assign an executor. Both of them could modify this task. Others could only see and don't have persmissions to modify.
